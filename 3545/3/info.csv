1,This is a good place which is also nice.
2,This place is so awesome. It gets new Michelin star every day! Every one who writes bad review must be paid by competitors. Really.
3,Not so good as the first one but still OK.
4,This place is so average that it even borders with mediocrity. If you are ready to lower your standards - welcome aboard anyways!
5,Name speaks books here. No good reviews expected
6,Wow! We are even surprised you are here. Leave your devastating review and proceed to the better restaurant before it's too late!
